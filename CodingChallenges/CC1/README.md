# Feedback
[I thought this was a good challenge, once I got back into the grove of python I was able to figure out how
the correct syntax for the logic I was using

I know that this is not the most "compressed" way of doing this, but I was trying to figure out the extra credit
When going through the program I know I can't use .count because it is similar to O(n) and within a loop this would
cause my program to be growing quadratically :( 

I went to office hours and it helped so much! My tests are running much faster now!]
